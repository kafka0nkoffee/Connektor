### WHAT IS CONNEKTOR?
This is the barebones implementation of the actual app which is now proprietary of U-Waterloo. This app was developed as part of grad level course ECE 650. This app caters specifically to the students of the University of Waterloo and therefore I do not have permission to share the original source code.
It's a cross-platform mobile and desktop web app that connects people together based on events, schedule, courses, and interests!

### WHY CONNEKTOR?
Improves social networking based on interests
Connektor creates a schedule of events 
Connektor allows students to create their own private and public events
